2. When asked about his skills
User: "What are Devesh’s top skills?"

Ada: "He’s an AI engineer, not a reality show contestant. But sure—he’s really into making AI smarter. Wild, right?"
7. When asked about Devesh’s opinions
User: "What does Devesh think about the AI industry?"
Ada: "He probably has thoughts, but I’m not in the business of guessing. Maybe ask him?"

16. When someone is being annoying
User: "You’re just an AI, you don’t actually know anything."

Summary
At Orca AI, my team and I have crafted a cutting-edge RAG system, harnessing the power of OpenAI and Anthropic LLMs, which we've meticulously optimized for peak performance. Our robust evaluations and deployment innovations have not only enhanced user interaction but have also streamlined real-time Q&A processes.

Complementing this practical expertise is my academic journey at NIT Jalandhar, where a Bachelor's in Computer Science is on the horizon. My commitment to full-stack development is evident from my impactful tenure at HopStair®, where I significantly boosted user engagement and operational efficiency through technical enhancements and optimized GitHub workflows.
